  "nameText": "EigenLayer",
  "detailIntroText": "EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that introduces restaking, a new primitive in cryptoeconomic security. This primitive enables the rehypothecation of ETH on the consensus layer. Users who stake ETH can opt-in to EigenLayer smart contracts to restake their ETH and extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network. Part of EigenLayer's potential lies in its ability to aggregate and extend cryptoeconomic security through restaking, and to validate new applications being built on top of Ethereum.",
