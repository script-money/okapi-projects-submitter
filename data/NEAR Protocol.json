  "detailIntroText": "NEAR is a sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that aims to incentivize a network of computers to operate a platform for developers to create and launch decentralized applications. Central to its design is the concept of sharding, a process that splits the network's infrastructure into several segments so that nodes only have to handle a fraction of the network's transactions. The NEAR mainnet went live in August 2020.",
