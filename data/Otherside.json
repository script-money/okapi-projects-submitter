  "detailIntroText": "Otherside is a gamified, interoperable metaverse where players own the world, any NFT can become a playable character, and thousands of people can play together at the same time. The game blends mechanics from MMORPGs and Web3-enabled virtual worlds. An Otherdeed NFT represents more than a mere picture of land; it's an access token to participate in playtesting and co-creation of Otherside. Additionally, each Otherdeed NFT depicts a Plot of land that will be available in Otherside, with a unique composition of natural elements, resources, elemental attributes, and more.",
