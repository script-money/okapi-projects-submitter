  "detailIntroText": "AltLayer is a system of highly scalable, application-dedicated execution layers that derive security from an underlying L1/L2. It is designed as a modular and pluggable framework for a multi-chain and multi-VM world. At its core, AltLayer consists of several optimistic rollup-like execution layers called flash layers, featuring a novel innovation that makes them disposable and thus highly resource-optimized.",
