  "detailIntroText": "Heroes of Mavia is a play-to-earn MMO strategy game that combines fantasy elements from the popular mobile strategy base-building game Clash of Clans. Players construct and develop their bases, train armies, and battle other players across the Mavia island. As the player's base and army expand, they can attack more difficult opponents and earn tokens in return, which can be used to upgrade the base and create special super-troops called Heroes.",
