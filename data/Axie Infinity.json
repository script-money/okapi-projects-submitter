  "detailIntroText": "Axie Infinity is a turn-based card game developed by Sky Mavis. It allows players to breed, raise, battle, and trade Axie creatures. In mid-2021, Axie Infinity became popular and sparked a gamefi boom. Players can earn two tokens: Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Small Love Potions (SLP) when playing Axie Infinity in Adventure or Arena modes. AXS serves as a governance token, allowing token holders to vote on the future development of the gaming experience. SLP is the in-game token used for breeding Axies.",
