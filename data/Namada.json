It natively interoperates with fast-finality chains via IBC and with Ethereum via a trustless two-way bridge. For privacy, Namada deploys an upgraded version of the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) circuit, which allows all assets to share a common shielded set. Namada is Anoma's first fractal instance and deploys Version 1 of the Anoma protocol.",
