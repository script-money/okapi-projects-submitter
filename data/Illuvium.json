  "detailIntroText": "Illuvium is an open-world RPG adventure game on the Ethereum blockchain that allows players to collect, exchange, and battle NFT assets. In Illuvium, players will encounter creatures called Illuvials that can be defeated and captured. If a capture is successful, a new NFT asset representing the Illuvial is minted and stored in a wallet. These NFTs can then be used in battle or exchanged. Additionally, Illuvium will provide these features with zero gas fees by leveraging the Layer-2 solution Immutable X.",
